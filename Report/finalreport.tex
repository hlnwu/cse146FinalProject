\title{Recidivism Final Project Report}
\author{Andi Zhao, Helen Wu, Ryan Sun}
\date{\today}
\begin{abstract}
In a situation where algorithms dictate the future of humanity, one must proceed with extreme caution. For example, \emph{COMPAS}, a software that is employed by the legal system to predict the recidivism rate of criminals, came under fire for neglecting the aspect of fairness in 2016. The ProPublica organization discovered racial bias within the predicted results, indicating a lack of thought and consideration of ethics while creating the algorithm. Using a dataset from the Iowa state government correctional center website, our final project focuses on this subject matter by attempting to predict recidivism with and without eliminating protected features from the training set to see if it has any effect on predicting recidivism. Pre-processing was required to eliminate unnecessary features and missing information. This report will detail the process in which we gathered and processed the data, as well as the conclusions that we drew from comparing our different models.

\section{Motivation and Objective}
\hspace{5mm}In recent years, the traditional justice system has been accused of being biased to minority populations. In an attempt to resolve this issue, researchers developed \emph{COMPAS} (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), a tool used to circumvent the need for human judgement. The reason that it came under fire was because it was yielding biased results where “blacks are almost twice as likely as whites to be labeled a higher risk but not actually re-offend”\cite{1}. In addition, privacy and fairness have been at the forefront of modern artificial intelligence research. Some researchers have attempted to train models without protected attributes to avoid lawsuits. We wondered if eliminating protected attributes from the training set actually has any effects on the accuracy and precision of the model. If the protected attribute has no effect on the accuracy of the model, it would mean that either race has no effect on the outcome of the model or that race was predicted. On the other hand, if race does have an effect, it would mean that the researchers were correct to hide the protected attribute. 


Our intention is to use Iowa’s recidivism dataset to train a model with and without race as one of its features to determine if race is a factor in determining recidivism. We also attempt to predict race from recidivism data to see whether or not the results are significant enough to associate race and recidivism. Our plan was to train two models, one with logistic regression and the other with decision trees, to compare accuracy, and other statistics. The goal of this project is to produce models that predict with similar accuracies to that of \emph{COMPAS}, as well as to uncover the relationship between using race as a feature and the corresponding results for predicting recidivism risk scores.

\section{Ethical Issues}

\hspace{5mm}The ProPublica study showcased the dangers of algorithmic decision making without concern for ethics, namely race, which can be detrimental to a true understanding and accurate modeling of recidivism. Additionally, the institutional biases within the \emph{COMPAS} algorithm directly affects our justice system because \emph{COMPAS} risk scores are actually considered by judges during sentencing in certain US states. The chart below shows the flaws and clear biases of blindly using the \emph{COMPAS} assessment to identify risk scores for an individual during sentencing.

In our study, we are primarily concerned about whether or not using race as a feature will affect the prediction of recidivism for an individual. By including and excluding race as an attribute, we are able to create different models and compare their results, thus allowing us to determine whether or not race was a significant factor in the predictions.


\section{Domain and Dataset}

\hspace{5mm}Initially, we wanted to use ProPublica's released data set as our main source of data. However, after analyzing the CSV file, we realized it was too convoluted to understand. Many of the column names were not self-explanatory and the documentation for each feature was lacking. Furthermore, there were duplicate information for some of the individuals, and cleaning and analyzing the data set would have taken far too long. After speaking to our TA about our project, we decided to utilize another data set released by Iowa state's government correctional center facility. Not only were these feature names straightforward and easy to understand, the data was cleaner and more recent. 

The data set contained recidivism information for 26,020 individuals from 2007-2013 in the state of Iowa. In total, there were 17 columns, with the "Return to Prison" column indicating whether the individual recidivated within the last 3 years. Out of the 17 attributes, age, race, and sex were the only 3 protected attributes in the data set. To protect the identities even further, each individuals age at release fell into a 5 categories; no actual ages were revealed. Strangely, the race category did not contain a unique Hispanic value as each of the other race groups were either Hispanic or Non-Hispanic (this can be seen in the graph below). This phenomenon in the data set is unusual as according to the 2010 US census, the Hispanic or Latino population was around 6\% of the total population, making it the second highest ethnic group population in the state.\cite{2}

After reviewing the data set, we decided to choose 5 non-protected attributes we thought were beneficial and relevant to creating our models. These 5 features were: Release Type, Age At Release, Offense Classification, Offense Type, and Target Population. Since we also wanted to test whether or not race affected the prediction results, we also added the race attribute as one of our features for two of our four models. While the former 5 features were relatively clean, the latter race feature was a little more difficult. Incomplete data (i.e., ‘White -’, ‘Black -’, ‘NA -’) littered the race column, and since we were not able to differentiate which group these incomplete values belonged to, we removed them from our data set. In addition, we replaced NaN with -1 and proceeded to remove any rows with missing values to avoid future complications of fitting models. This brought our total data set size down to 5,195.

Before we removed any rows, we wanted to see the original data set's ethnic group statistics and how it could impact our results. In Figure 2, the number of White and Non-Hispanics greatly outnumber the rest of the ethnicities. As we will see later, the heavily skewed data impacted the predictions of the four models we created.

\section{Models and Algorithms}

\hspace{5mm} We used sklearn’s decision tree as well as logistic regression packages to model the data. We created multiple models to predict both race and recidivism. When predicting for recidivism, we used both decision tree as well as logistic regression models. Models included and excluded race to check if race impacted recidivism predictions. When predicting for race, we used a decision tree with the recidivism feature.

In the decision tree models, a majority of the columns were binarized since the features were mainly categorical. After the transformation of the dataset into binarized values, the data is split into the testing and training sets before predicting recidivism.

Ryan Sun - 

Huanlei Wu did most of the pre-processing and pre-processing visualizations. At first, she considered adding neural networks and random forest classifiers as models, but ultimately decided against it. However, the code is still in the Jupyter notebook. She also helped Andi Zhao with some of the visualizations for the logistic regression model at the end of the project, mainly the two recidivism prediction graphs. In addition, she also took up the task of cleaning up and beautifying the group's code so it was more readable and easier to understand. Along with the whole group, she helped analyze the results, create the presentation poster, as well as write and proofread the final report. Her focus of the report was mainly on the "Domain and Dataset" portion.
